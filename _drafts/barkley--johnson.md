My brother says that all the best food in the world is a combo of meat, cheese and bread and our spread today at Barkley Johnson in Yarraville pretty much proves him right. We ordered the cold cuts and three cheese board and this is what we got. I loved that their default for the cheeses is “hard, soft and blue”, which worked so well. The pork neck and spicy salami were particular standouts on the meat side. All washed down with a delightfully golden Albariño for me and a Hop Nation IPA for the husband. Another lovely afternoon whiled away in Barkley Johnson. They just keep reeling us back in.
