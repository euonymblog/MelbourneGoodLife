One of my jobs while I was studying for my Masters here in Melbourne was organising the visits of American Eisenhower Fellows to Australia. One of them was in Melbourne and we met to go for dinner. When I asked him what he'd like, he said "traditional Australian food". I was a bit stumped - what counted as traditional Australian? Smashed avo? Pho? Barbecue? If he comes back to Australia, I know exactly where I will take him - Charcoal Lane, which serves up delicious high-end cuisine inspired by bush tucker.

Kangaroo, Emu, pepperberry-infused gin, lemon myrtle foam, saltbush, finger limes - the ingredients are a shopping list of the best of Australian indigenous foodstuffs. Charcoal Lane is a social enterprise, training young indigenous people in hospitality trades. Sometimes that means the service isn't fine-dining standard, but is always charming. A great wine list accompanies the very self-assured cooking. This is fin-dining at not-quite fine-dining prices.
