One of the reasons us Poms come to live in Australia is for the good weather. Of course, some of us end up in Melbourne, which is better than Northern Europe, but still somewhat unreliable. Having said that, a rooftop cinema makes much more sense here than it does in the UK - in all the years I've been (and I went my second weekend in Melbourne), we've only been washed out once.

The Rooftop Cinema sits atop the wonderful Curtin House, which could be its own website (and very probably is). It is part of Rooftop Bar, which is open all year and serves mulled cider in the winter months, which is worth knowing when you're out shopping. But the space really comes into its own in the summer months, when the deckchairs come out and interesting films are screened. They have Oscar-buzz films, recent releases, old classics, cults films - the program usually has something for everyone. Add that to the excellent cocktails from the bar, the extremely good burgers and pidapipo icecream and you have all the makings of a great night out. Just remember to take something to wrap up in - it is Melbourne, after all.
