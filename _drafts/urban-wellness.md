When I lived in London, floating was my absolutely favourite form of relaxation and wellbeing. I hadn’t done one since I moved to Australia and so was very excited when a centre opened round the corner from where I was living at the time. I first went to Urban Wellness after a tough few days delivering a really high-level conference. The tension beforehand and the full-on nature of the event itself meant I was in dire need of some relaxation therapy!&nbsp;

The tank was slightly different to how I had done before and I suppose could be a little confronting for a first timer – it looks a little bit like an escape pod in a sci-fi film. But I hopped right in, shut the tank and started floating. There is an option of a light, and the whale-noise style music is calming as you start off. But if you relax into it, it’s like an hour lying on the most comfortable bed you’ll ever find. At the end of it, the music comes back on. I’m not sure if I had fallen asleep or was just in that sort of twilight snoozing thing, but I felt very woozy as I got out of the tank and was happy for all the handles around the room! Then a shower in one of the best showers I’ve ever experienced, with lovely Sukin products and I was ready to go. I headed out and had a glass of coconut water and chatted to the people there while I came back to normality.

Floating is a great form of relaxation and Urban Wellness is a welcome addition to flotation venues in Melbourne.
