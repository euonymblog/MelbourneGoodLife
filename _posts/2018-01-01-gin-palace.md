Gin has been enjoying something of a renaissance recently, and Australia has been a part of that. Archie Rose, Patient Wolf, Four Pillars, Kangaroo Island - all craft gins that stand up against some of the best from around the world. The Gin Palace probably feels like the follower of an underground band that has just hit the big time - happy to see others get with the program, edged with smugness that they liked them before they were cool.

This is a shrine to the juniper-flavoured spirit, with over 200 gins (including Jenevers) and a dizzying array of cocktail choices. From traditional gin drinks (two pages of martinis and negronis) to gin takes on other cocktails (a gin Old Fashioned), this is the place to come and worship at the altar. It's a no-messing about place - table service, no food, no banging music. Just somewhere for having a few drinks with good company. I love it.
