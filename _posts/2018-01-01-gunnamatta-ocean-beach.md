Melbourne is, as many of you know, on Port Phillip. This body of water has been very good to me - I'm not sure I'd have got so far with learning to sail on the open ocean, for a start. But I do miss walking along the beach with pounding waves. Which is why I was delighted to discover the back beaches on the Mornington Peninsula, the best of which is, in my opinion, Gunnamatta Ocean Beach.

This beautiful surf beach is fringed by sand dunes. It is popular with everyone from surfers to families. In the summer it has a surf-lifesaver on duty, but not always in the winter. When we were there recently the flags were quite close together, but the weather was coming in, which might explain that.

There is a lot of parking across two car parks, and lots of space on the beach, even when it's busy. Be careful about the nesting Hooded Plovers though - they were there first and we've done enough harm to them already.
