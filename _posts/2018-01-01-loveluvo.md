Nobody likes cleaning (well, I certainly don't), but if you have to clean, then at least go to Loveluvo. This social enterprise creates and curates an interesting range of cleaning products, shampoos, conditioners and other curiosities. For the most part they are ecologically friendly and for their own products, once you have bought the container you can get refills, which greatly reduces the cost on both your wallet and the planet.

We bought an orange-based multi-use cleanser in concentrated form, which can be diluted for a variety of uses. We call it the magic spray, it's that effective - it cleans just about anything and leaves a lovely non-bleachy smell.

I'd shop at LoveLuvo on the basis of the products, so it is an added bonus that they provide long-term employment for people with disabilities. Your shopping habits can go a long way to making a difference in this world and LoveLuvo delivers on many fronts.
