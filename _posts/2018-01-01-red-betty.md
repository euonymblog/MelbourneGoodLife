Red Betty is down an alleyway in Brunswick. Just visiting it feels a bit louche and exciting, as you have to know it is there. Entering gives the same feeling of a speakeasy or private bar, with a quiet corridor leading to a low-lit barroom. But that's where the edginess ends - once inside, it's like being at a friend's house, but with a bar. Which is sort of what it is, as one of the owners is a friend of mine. The four owners have created a really friendly atmosphere, where anyone coming in is treated like one of the gang.

They have Collingwood beer on tap and an array of wines and spirits. The cocktail menu is composed of the classics. A small stage sometimes welcomes live music and there is a set of turntables which play eclectic tunes when they're not being used for getting people dancing.

My days of crushing into bars with a queue three people deep and banging house music are well and truly over. That's why Red Betty is one of my favourite places to drink these days - good tunes and good company shared over a glass or two.
