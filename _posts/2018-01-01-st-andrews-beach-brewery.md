I wasn't sure whether to list this new venue under Drink or Eat. It makes craft beers but also serves up pizzas, burgers and bar food. I went with Drink in the end as the beers are the stars here. I ordered a tasting paddle which came with a little glass of each of their four beers. The lager, golden ale and pilsner were nice, but the pale ale was outstanding - no surprise that the take home fridge of pale ale was empty!

We had chicken wings and sweet potato fries and they were both really good - the wings melty and tangy and the fries crunchy and salty. It had only been open a week when we were there and it was very busy. It is built in an old stables and there are tables in the horseboxes along the two sides, each with a plaque marking its most famous occupant.

There were children running around, so it seems family-friendly and the golf-buggy from the far car-park was a nice touch. They certainly deserve for it to work out and in that position in the summer, they're giving themselves the best possible start.
