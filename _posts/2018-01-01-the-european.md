My first weekend in Melbourne was White Night 2014 and I was meeting my friend from London, Jeremy, for a drink, so he could show me round town. He made the amusing suggestion that we meet at the European, given that I had just left the European Commission. Very droll… Anyway, we had a drink there, and its French cafe decor and all-European wine menu did make me feel at home.

Almost four years later, the same Jeremy and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary with a special lunch at the same place, and I had met several  friends there for drinks in-between. It isn't the cheapest place, but the food is almost as good as a trip home. On our wedding anniversary we shared the cote de boeuf and it was absolutely delicious - rare as can be but easy to cut, which spoke to the quality of the meat. I've had the charcuterie plate a couple of times and the pate and cold meats are of excellent quality. For an out-of-town European, this place is a nice touch of home.
