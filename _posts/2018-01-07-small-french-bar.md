You might have guessed from other posts that I have a bit of a thing about Europe. In particular I have a real affinity for France. My grandmother was a French teacher, my parents live there, and I have a small house there too (available to rent!). Much as I love Australia, I do miss the sort of French eatery you find all over France, where someone is churning out amazing food done simply with good ingredients, washed down with delicious wine.

So you can imagine my delight when I found the Small French Bar. It is, as the name suggests, small and the punters are packed in pretty tight. The menu offers real French classics - confit de canard, steak - as well as cheese and cold meat plates. On Thursdays they have oysters for $1, and I'd love to know where they get them from as they are some of the best I have had here, especially served as they are with a little teaspoon of raspberry vinaigrette.

The wine are all French. I've often had the Muscadet, as I'm eating seafood, but have also enjoyed a few of the other drops on offer.

For a homesick European with a cheese and oyster obsession, this place is a real find.
