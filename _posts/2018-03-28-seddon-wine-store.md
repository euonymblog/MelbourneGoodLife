I'm a wine buff. I don't make any secret about it - I love wine. I don't think I'm a wine *snob*, per se, but there's not much better for me than a visit to a small boutique winemaker, or a bottle of some unusual wine variety. We were lucky in Balaclava, having [XM4](http://melbournegood.life/drink/2018/02/03/xm4.html) and a Blackhearts and Sparrows round the corner. And we were lucky moving to Seddon, where we have Seddon Wine Store round the corner.

This is a place run by people who love wine. Not people who want to show how much they know about wine, or to fleece you out of money for over-priced wines. These are people who love finding interesting new bottles, who want to stretch your idea of what is good and want to encourage you to buy something different for less than you'd pay for a bottle of Jacobs Creek. They sell dry sherry, for goodness sake. Not the goodness of my liver, but definitely some sort of goodness.

It's a bar as well, serving quality gins and several cocktails, and a nice selection of European-style bar snacks - olives, peppers, meat, cheese. But this is first and foremost a wine shop. And a very good one.
