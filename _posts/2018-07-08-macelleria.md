Last night I was in Swan Street (before the rugby - Go Storm!) and had a craving for grilled meat. The first place we came across was Macelleria which can perhaps best be described as Nando’s meets a high-end butcher. You go up to the counter, choose your cut of meat, say how you would like it done, order a few sides and then a few minutes later a steak that feels like you could cut it with a fork is brought to your table. Everything worked well - the green pepper sauce had a real kick. The rustic fries were fresh and tasty. The kale, quinoa and beetroot salad was fresh and light in welcome contrast to all the protein and carbs I was downing. All washed down with a Little Creatures Pale Ale. If removing some of the frills gets me a steak that good for under $50 a head all in, I’m fine with it.
