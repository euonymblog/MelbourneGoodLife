Rudimentary in Footscray serves up 1) delicious food in a 2) recycled shipping container. Both of those facts make me very happy. Unlike so many Eggs Benny, their hollandaise was freshly made and the crisps on the side of my Wagyu burger were just about the best Iâ€™ve ever had. Add good beers and a spot on Bloody Mary and you had two very happy punters!
