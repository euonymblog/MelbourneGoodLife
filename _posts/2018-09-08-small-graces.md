We didn't know this when we moved West, but Footscray really does seem to be on its way to being Melbourne's coolest secret. I've got a backlog of places around here to write up and more coming up that I want to go and check out. But I thought I'd start with Small Graces because it has been getting a lot of love from Melbourne foodies recently, not least those over at [Time Out](https://www.timeout.com/melbourne/restaurants/the-best-cafes-in-melbourne){: target="_blank"}.

A lot of the buzz has been because the chef has Lake House pedigree. It's also because they make a point of using locally sourced produce and take the effort to step as lightly upon the planet as is possible for a business based on consumption.&nbsp;

But basically a cafe only works well if the food is good, whatever its hype, and Small Graces is great. The food is interesting, with chef Diego's Hispanic heritage visible in the use of arepas and morcilla rather than Melbourne's usual fritters and chorizo. I particularly like their "small plates". They take the elements of most of their dishes and make them available on their own, allowing the diner a sort of "pick your own adventure" style eating experience.

There are some interesting pairings as well - last time we were there I had the morcilla as part of a tasting plate, which came with some delicious dried pear.

With good coffees and fresh juices, it's a great place for starting a weekend. And now that they are open for dinner on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, for finishing a week.
