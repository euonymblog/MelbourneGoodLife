Here's an itinerary to impress on a first date (assuming it's in the summer months).<br />
<br />
Start with a drink at the European. Order the charcuterie plate (having checked that your invited eats meat, of course) with a couple of glasses of Spanish Cava or a nice light French red.<br />
<br />
Then head down Lonsdale Street to the Rooftop Bar atop Curtin House for a late-night film. Get there around 8, so you can enjoy a cocktail or two (their Pisco Sours are particularly good) and be at the front of the queue for when the cinema opens. If you're still peckish, their burgers are amazing. If either of you have limited mobility (or just a bad back) sit in the directors chairs up the back. And don't forget to take a light blanket or good shawl - it can get a bit chilly up there.<br />
<br />
If all is going well and you don't want the night to end, head to the Gin Palace for a nightcap. The martini menu alone is worth a visit. The place is dark and seats are quite close. If you've got this far and it's still going well, then I think we can leave it to you from here...!
